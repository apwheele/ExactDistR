This code conducts an exact test between two discrete distributions. For example, if you have 3 crimes that happen on Monday and 2 on Tuesday, is that consistent with the offender picking crimes for random days of the week? The typical Chi-Square statistic is based on asymptotics, but with a small number of observations you can estimate an exact distribution.

# Example Use

See this [blog post of mine for an example use of the test](https://andrewpwheeler.wordpress.com/2015/12/17/testing-day-of-week-crime-randomness-paper-published/), as well as how to estimate the power of the test.
